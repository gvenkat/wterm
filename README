ABOUT

WTerm is a web-based terminal emulator plugin for JQuery. JQuery is a powerful 
javascript library that helps write compact, easy to read code. JQuery is also
compaitable with most browsers in wide use today. To Learn more about JQuery

WTerm is simple plugin to emulate terminal on the browser. To start using 
this plugin the simplest thing to do is:


  $( document ).ready( function() { $('#terminal').webterm() } )


By Default WTerm comes with just one command. 'clear' clears the screen.
To register new commands you simple register a command like this:

  $.register_command( 'command_name', function( tokens ) { return 'this is what i did' } );

tokens are passed to your function, its an array of the entire command
broken into tokens. Tokens are assumed to be seperated by whitespace. The token seperator
is not configurable. For Example:

  $ moo boo whoo

creates a structure:

  new Array( 'moo', 'boo', 'whoo')

and passes this to your function.


If you want the command to be run on the server and the response to be 
published on your web terminal, you simply pass URL in place of a function

  $.register_command( 'command_from_server', '/i/me/mine.php' );
  $.register_command( 'command_from_server', 'http://www.yourdomain.com/i/me/mine.php' );



WTERM

WTerm is highly configurable, you can configure various parts of the terminal, wherever possible
WTerm uses sensible defaults. To Configure WTerm you will need to pass a singleton object at 
initialization state:

  $( '#terminal' ).wterm(  { key: 'value', ... } );


The Following list documents the configurable properties of the terminal

PS1                 - Primary Prompt ( Defaults to 'wterm $' )
TERMINAL_CLASS      - Class name that apply to terminal Container ( Defaults to 'wterm_terminal' )
PROMPT_CLASS        - Class name that apply to prompt ( Defaults to 'wterm_prompt' )
THEME_CLASS_PREFIX  - Theme Class Name that will be prefixed to themes for example theme 'subbeam' will
                    - automatically become 'prefix_subbeam'
DEFAULT_THEME       - Default Theme Class Name defaults to 'green_on_black'
HIGHLIGHT_CLASS     - Class name to apply to highlighted text
KEYWORD_CLASS       - Class name to apply to keywords
WIDTH               - Width for container
HEIGHT              - Height for container
WELCOME_MESSAGE     - Default Welcome Message to show when the terminal is first initialized
NOT_FOUND           - Message to show when a command is not found
                    - 'CMD' in this string will automatically be 
                    - translated to command user typed in
HELP                - Help not finalized
AUTOCOMPLETE        - Boolen, Autocomplete enabled/disabled ( By Default Enabled )
HISTORY             - Boolen, History enabled/disabled ( By Default Enabled ) 
AJAX_METHOD         - HTTP Method to call must be GET/POST ( Defaults to GET )
AJAX_PARAM          - Parameter to send the command in for HTTP request ( Default to tokens )


So to disable Auto Complete you will do:

  $( '#terminal' ).wterm( { AUTOCOMPLETE: false, HISTORY: false } );

To Send POST instead of GET and to customize request param you will do:

  $( '#terminal' ).wterm( { AJAX_METHOD: 'POST', AJAX_PARAM: 'command' } );
